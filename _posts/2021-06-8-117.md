Minecraft 1.17: _Caves & Cliffs, Part 1_ is now released, and along with it, Fabric itself and many mods already.

The release of [Fabric for Minecraft 1.16](https://fabricmc.net/2020/06/23/116.html) was almost a year ago. Since then, we have updated to all 48 snapshot and release versions of Minecraft. We recently released a [blog post](https://fabricmc.net/2021/05/27/117-for-developers.html) covering what the 1.17 update means for mod developers.
