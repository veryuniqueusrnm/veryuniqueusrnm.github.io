Quick update - after the slightly imperfect release of Loader 0.4.0, we're bringing the bugfix version 0.4.1.

Changelog:

  * Added a mapping resolution API for developers! This should be a big step in making reflection/method handle accesses to Minecraft code dev/prod-friendly without much hassle.
  * Minor mod loading time optimizations.
  * Fixed dedicated server support.
    * Unfortunately, for the time being this means using the Fabric installer to create a server install + dropping the server JAR in yourself. Sorry!
  * *Actually* fixed all of the Mixin-features-in-development-environment-dependencies corner cases.
    * Tested on Arcane Magic, which has quite a few of them, so it must be true.
  * Updated libraries: tiny-remapper.

Thank you for being a part of the Fabric community!
