# Fabric for Minecraft 1.15.1

Fabric for Minecraft 1.15.1 has been released. All 1.15 mods should work just fine. If you missed it please read the [Fabric for 1.15 announcement](https://fabricmc.net/2019/12/10/115.html). If you want to discuss this new update please join us on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/v6v4pMv) server.

There was a slight delay in the update due to me not being near a computer, sorry about that.

Have fun,
